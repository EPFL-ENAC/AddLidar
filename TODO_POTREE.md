Below is a suggested plan outlining the steps and the order in which you can implement your workflow:

### 1. **Set Up the State Store (Redis)**
- **Design the Schema:**  
  Decide on what metadata you need to store for each file (for example, file path, modification timestamp, or a hash of the file) to determine whether it’s new or modified.
- **Implement Update Logic:**  
  When a file is processed, record its state in Redis. This could be a simple key-value where the key is the file path and the value is the file’s last-modified timestamp or hash.
- **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):**
    Ensure your Kubernetes pods have a PVC mounted where potreeConverter writes the generated .octree files.
- **S3 Credentials and Config:**
    Configure your container with the proper s3cmd configuration (either via a mounted config file or environment variables) so that the S3 upload can authenticate and target the correct bucket.
- **Redis for File State:**
    Set up Redis to store metadata (e.g., file path, modification timestamp/hash) to track which files have already been processed.

### 2. **Develop a Scanning Script**
- **File Discovery:**  
  Use a tool like the `find` command to recursively list all `.las` and `.laz` files within your directory.
- **State Comparison:**  
  For each file found, check Redis to see if:
  - The file is not present (new file)  
  - The file’s modification timestamp/hash has changed (updated file)
- **Filtering:**  
  Filter out files that have already been processed and have not changed.

### 3. **Integrate potreeConverter**
- **Command Invocation:**  
  For each new or updated file, run the `potreeConverter` command to generate the corresponding `.octree`.  
  Example command:
  ```bash
  potreeConverter <input_file> -o <output_directory>
  ```
- **Error Handling:**  
  Ensure that your script catches and logs any errors during conversion.

### 4. **Trigger Kubernetes Jobs**
- **Job Generation:**  
  For each file that needs processing, use the Kubernetes API to create a Job that runs the conversion process. This allows parallel or isolated processing of files.
- **Resource Management:**  
  Configure resource requests and limits for these jobs appropriately.

After the .octree has been successfully generated:

- **S3 Upload Step:**
In the same job (or as a follow-up job/task), execute the command:
```bash
s3cmd put --guess-mime-type --acl-public --recursive -v /path/to/octree/ s3://your-target-bucket/path/
```
 - Notes:
   - Replace /path/to/octree/ with the actual directory in your PVC where the files are stored.
   - Ensure that the s3cmd configuration is accessible in the job's environment.
- **Validation & Logging:**
Log the output of the s3cmd command to verify that the upload was successful.
Optionally, add error handling or retry logic if the upload fails.


### 5. **Update State Post-Processing**
- **Success Check:**  
  After a job completes successfully, update Redis with the new state (timestamp/hash) for the processed file.
- **Failure Handling:**  
  In case of a failure, log the event and consider a retry mechanism or alerting.

### 6. **Schedule the Workflow with a CronJob**
- **Kubernetes CronJob:**  
  Create a Kubernetes CronJob that runs every 24 hours. This CronJob will:
  - Launch the scanning script.
  - Trigger Kubernetes Jobs for any new or updated files.
- **CronJob Definition:**  
  Your CronJob YAML should include the schedule (e.g., `"0 0 * * *"` for midnight daily) and reference your container image that contains the scanning and job-triggering logic.

### 7. **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Centralized Logging:**  
  Ensure that both the scanning script and the individual jobs log their output and errors, so you can troubleshoot issues if needed.
- **Alerts:**  
  Set up alerts for failures or issues in file processing so that they can be addressed promptly.

### Summary Workflow
1. **Initialize State Store:** Set up Redis and decide on metadata for file tracking.
2. **File Scan:** CronJob runs a scanning script that uses `find` to list files.
3. **State Check:** For each file, compare its state with what’s stored in Redis.
4. **Trigger Jobs:** For new/modified files, create Kubernetes Jobs to run `potreeConverter`.
5. **Process and Update:** Upon successful conversion, update Redis with the new file state.
6. **Repeat Daily:** The CronJob re-runs every 24 hours to pick up any changes.

This approach ensures that your system only processes files that are new or have changed, while leveraging Kubernetes for scalable job management and Redis for efficient state tracking.


# Redis implementation

Below is a deeper dive into how you can design and configure Redis to track your files, including the fields you mentioned.

---

## Redis Data Model for File Tracking

### 1. **Key Structure**
- **Key Naming Convention:**  
  Use a unique key for each file. A common approach is to use the file’s absolute or relative path as part of the key. For example:
  ```plaintext
  file:/path/to/your/file.las
  ```
  This way, you can quickly retrieve or update a file’s record using its path.

### 2. **Data Structure: Redis Hash**
- **Why a Hash?**  
  Redis hashes are perfect for storing a set of fields (key-value pairs) that describe a single file. They’re lightweight and allow you to update individual fields without rewriting the whole record.

- **Proposed Fields:**
  - **filename:** The base name of the file (e.g., `file.las`).
  - **filepath:** The full path of the file in your directory structure.
  - **octreepath:** The location (path) where the `.octree` generated by potreeConverter is stored on the PVC.
  - **timestamp_file:** The file’s last modified timestamp when it was last scanned. This helps detect changes.
  - **timestamp_octree:** The timestamp when the corresponding `.octree` was generated. It indicates the currency of the transformation.
  - **timestamp_s3:** The timestamp when the `.octree` was successfully uploaded to S3.

### 3. **Example Record in Redis**
For a file located at `/data/las/area1/file.las`, your hash could look like:

```plaintext
Key: file:/data/las/area1/file.las
Fields:
  filename         -> file.las
  filepath         -> /data/las/area1/file.las
  octreepath       -> /data/octree/area1/file.octree
  timestamp_file   -> 1678473600   (Unix timestamp)
  timestamp_octree -> 1678477200   (Unix timestamp)
  timestamp_s3     -> 1678480800   (Unix timestamp)
```

### 4. **Workflow Integration**
- **During Scanning:**  
  When your CronJob runs and scans the folder:
  1. **Check for Existence:** Look up the Redis hash for a given file key (`file:/path/to/file.las`).
  2. **Compare Timestamps:**  
     - If the current file’s modification timestamp (obtained from the filesystem) is newer than `timestamp_file` stored in Redis, mark it as needing reprocessing.
  3. **New Files:**  
     - If the file key does not exist, it’s a new file and should be processed.

- **After Processing:**
  1. **Conversion:**  
     - Run `potreeConverter` to generate the `.octree` file.
     - Update or create the Redis hash with:
       - The current file’s modification time as `timestamp_file`.
       - The conversion time as `timestamp_octree`.
       - The generated `.octree` path in `octreepath`.
  2. **S3 Upload:**  
     - Once the upload is completed via `s3cmd`, update `timestamp_s3` with the current time.
  
### 5. **Atomic Updates and Concurrency**
- **Atomicity:**  
  Redis commands like `HMSET` (or `HSET` for individual fields) ensure that you update the file’s record atomically. This is important in a distributed environment where multiple jobs might try to update the same record concurrently.
- **Using Transactions:**  
  For operations that require checking and setting in a single step, consider using Redis transactions (MULTI/EXEC) or Lua scripts to maintain consistency.

### 6. **Example Python Code Snippet**
Here’s a small example using Python and the `redis-py` library:

```python
import redis
import time

# Connect to Redis (adjust parameters as needed)
r = redis.Redis(host='your-redis-host', port=6379, db=0)

def update_file_record(filepath, filename, octreepath, file_ts, octree_ts=None, s3_ts=None):
    key = f"file:{filepath}"
    file_data = {
        "filename": filename,
        "filepath": filepath,
        "octreepath": octreepath,
        "timestamp_file": file_ts,
        "timestamp_octree": octree_ts if octree_ts else "",
        "timestamp_s3": s3_ts if s3_ts else ""
    }
    # HMSET is used to set multiple fields in a hash
    r.hmset(key, file_data)

# Example usage:
file_path = "/data/las/area1/file.las"
file_name = "file.las"
octree_path = "/data/octree/area1/file.octree"
timestamp_file = int(time.time())  # current timestamp for file scan

# Assume these timestamps are set after processing
timestamp_octree = int(time.time()) + 300  # example conversion time
timestamp_s3 = int(time.time()) + 600        # example upload time

update_file_record(file_path, file_name, octree_path, timestamp_file, timestamp_octree, timestamp_s3)
```

This code snippet demonstrates:
- How to construct a key.
- How to update the record with all necessary fields.
- How to set default values (if not available yet, you might store an empty string or a null indicator).

---

## Summary

1. **Key Structure:** Use a unique key such as `file:<filepath>`.
2. **Redis Hash Fields:**  
   - `filename`: File base name.
   - `filepath`: Full file path.
   - `octreepath`: Location of the generated `.octree`.
   - `timestamp_file`: File’s last modified time.
   - `timestamp_octree`: Conversion completion time.
   - `timestamp_s3`: Time when the file was uploaded to S3.
3. **Workflow Integration:**  
   - Check and update these values during scanning, conversion, and S3 upload steps.
4. **Atomic Operations:**  
   - Use atomic commands or transactions to ensure consistency.

This configuration not only helps in tracking which files have been processed, but also provides the necessary timestamps to detect when updates occur and when to trigger reprocessing.

# Resource intensive job

Both approaches have their merits, and the best choice depends on your priorities and operational constraints. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Single Image/Job Approach**

**Pros:**
- **Simplicity:**  
  One container performs both the conversion and upload in a sequential workflow, reducing orchestration complexity.
- **Fewer Moving Parts:**  
  Managing one job is straightforward, which is beneficial if the process is lightweight and failure scenarios are minimal.

**Cons:**
- **Tight Coupling:**  
  A failure in one step (e.g., S3 upload) could require re-running the entire process, even if conversion was successful.
- **Limited Scalability:**  
  You cannot scale or optimize the conversion and upload processes independently.
- **Error Isolation:**  
  Debugging is more challenging when both steps are bundled together.

---

### **Separate Images/Jobs Approach**

**Pros:**
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Each job focuses on a single task (one for conversion and one for upload), which simplifies debugging and allows for independent development.
- **Independent Scaling & Optimization:**  
  You can allocate different resources and tune parameters for each job. For example, conversion might be resource-intensive, whereas S3 uploads might be more I/O-bound.
- **Better Error Handling:**  
  If conversion succeeds but the upload fails, you can simply retry the upload job without redoing the conversion.
- **Flexibility:**  
  It’s easier to insert additional steps (e.g., validation or logging) between conversion and upload if needed.

**Cons:**
- **Increased Complexity in Orchestration:**  
  You’ll need to implement a mechanism to trigger the S3 upload job after conversion completes. This might involve:
  - Using a shared volume (PVC) where the conversion job writes the output.
  - Maintaining a state (e.g., with Redis or a message queue) that signals when the conversion is done.
  - Or even having the conversion job explicitly trigger the upload job via the Kubernetes API.
- **More Components to Manage:**  
  Two separate images and jobs mean additional configuration, monitoring, and maintenance.

---

### **Recommendation**

If your process is simple and you prefer an all-in-one solution, a single image/job might suffice. However, if you anticipate:
- **Resource contention,**
- **Frequent failures or retries,** or
- **A need for independent scaling and optimization,**

then separating them into two images and Kubernetes jobs is likely a better architectural choice.

For example, you could have:
1. **Conversion Job:**  
   - Uses the PotreeConverter image to process input files and write output to a PVC.
   - On success, it writes a record (or triggers an event) indicating the conversion is complete.

2. **S3 Upload Job:**  
   - Uses the s3cmd image.
   - Triggered either manually (via your FastAPI endpoint) or automatically (via an orchestrator or state check) to pick up the converted files from the PVC and upload them to S3.

This separation provides better fault tolerance and flexibility in managing each step of your pipeline.

---

Overall, if your operations and scaling needs are modest, the single-job approach keeps things simple. If you value robustness and independent error handling, the two-job approach will serve you better.
