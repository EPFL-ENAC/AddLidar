Python 3 and FastAPI Guidelines:

- use uv run pytest instead of  python -m pytest

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use type hints extensively for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Structure FastAPI applications using modular design (routers, services, models).
- Implement proper error handling with custom exception classes and middleware.
- Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests using pytest.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Implement logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Use Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and deployment.
- Follow RESTful API design principles.
