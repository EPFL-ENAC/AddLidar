# AddLidar

The AddLidar Project is a web-based system for storing, processing, and visualizing LiDAR datasets collected from airborne missions. The goal is to provide researchers with an efficient pipeline to access, process, and visualize large LiDAR datasets via a Kubernetes-based infrastructure.
